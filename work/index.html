<h1> Work </h1>
<p> I've written or presented on a fairly broad range of topics so why not share? Some of these were for classes, independent studies, or research projects/presentations. </p>
<ul>
  <li> 2017: <a href="Harakas-Quantum-LSE.pdf"> Quantum  Implementation  for  Solving  Linear  Systems  of Equations.</a> I had the chance to work on quantum computing using IBM's Quantum platform to design and run some computations on an actual quantum computer. I ended up writing this paper on solving linear systems of equations. </li>
  <li> 2016: <a href="Harakas-Side-Channels.pdf"> Analyzing Keystroke Vibrations.</a> Decoding keystrokes from nearby cell phone 
accelerometer data.  </li>
  <li> 2015: <a href="Harakas-3dPrinting.pdf"> Increasing Versatility of 3D Printing.</a> Presentation of my work on 3D printing and working to paramaterize the mechanical properties of polymers </li>
  <li> 2015: <a href="Harakas-ComparingDefectPredictionAccuracy2015.pdf"> Comparing Accuracy of Software Defect Prediction and its
Dimensionality.</a> Just an alright paper I wrote for my data mining class. </li>
</ul>
